# 🛡️ Security Policy

**Fused Gaming MCP Security Incident Response and Disclosure Policy**

---

## 1. Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### 1.1 Do NOT Report Publicly

**Never** open a public issue or discussion for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, follow the responsible disclosure process below.

### 1.2 Responsible Disclosure Process

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Email** security@fused-gaming.dev with details:
   - Vulnerability title
   - Affected versions (if known)
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Proof of concept (if safe to share)
   - Suggested fix (if available)

2. **Wait for acknowledgment** (within 24 hours)

3. **Work with us** on a fix timeline

4. **Coordinate disclosure** before public announcement

### 1.3 Disclosure Timeline

We commit to:

| Severity | Acknowledgment | Assessment | Fix Released | Public Disclosure |
|----------|---|---|---|---|
| Critical | 24 hours | 3 days | 7 days | Day 8+ |
| High | 24 hours | 3 days | 14 days | Day 15+ |
| Medium | 2 days | 5 days | 30 days | Day 31+ |
| Low | 3 days | 7 days | 90 days | Day 91+ |

## 2. Security Expectations

### What We Protect

- ✅ **Authentication systems** - User identities and sessions
- ✅ **Data confidentiality** - Encryption and access controls
- ✅ **Data integrity** - Prevention of unauthorized modification
- ✅ **Availability** - Protection against DoS
- ✅ **Supply chain** - Dependency security

### What We Don't Protect

We are **not** responsible for:

- ❌ Self-inflicted vulnerabilities (enabling experimental features, running untrusted code)
- ❌ Social engineering or phishing
- ❌ Physical security of deployment infrastructure
- ❌ User misconfiguration of firewall rules
- ❌ Zero-day vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (until publicly disclosed)

### Security by Default

- Secure-by-default: Safety is the default mode
- Users must opt-in to risky features
- Defaults are conservative
- No features that sacrifice security for convenience

---

## 3. Supported Versions

Security patches are provided for:

- ✅ **Latest major version**: Full support, all fixes
- ✅ **Previous major version**: Critical fixes only (6 months)
- ❌ **Older versions**: No support

Example: If current version is 2.x:
- 2.x: Full support
- 1.x: Critical fixes for 6 months after 2.0 release
- 0.x: No support

---

## 4. Incident Response

### 4.1 Detection

We monitor for:

- Automated scanning (npm audit, Snyk)
- Manual code review
- Community reports
- Third-party disclosures

### 4.2 Assessment

Upon receipt:

1. Verify the vulnerability exists
2. Determine which versions are affected
3. Assess severity (CVSS score)
4. Evaluate impact (confidentiality, integrity, availability)
5. Plan remediation approach

### 4.3 Remediation

For each vulnerability:

1. **Develop fix** (patched code or workaround)
2. **Test thoroughly** (unit tests, integration tests, manual testing)
3. **Create PR** with security tag `[SECURITY]`
4. **Fast-track review** (24-hour target)
5. **Tag release** with version bump
6. **Publish** new version to npm
7. **Announce** in release notes and security advisory

### 4.4 Communication

When a security update is released:

- [ ] Update GitHub Security Advisory
- [ ] Add entry to CHANGELOG.md (Security section)
- [ ] Publish release notes
- [ ] Post to community channels
- [ ] Email security contact list (if applicable)

## 6. Security Headers & Configuration

### Recommended Headers

```typescript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  // Prevent clickjacking
  res.setHeader('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY');
  
  // Prevent MIME type sniffing
  res.setHeader('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
  
  // Content Security Policy (primary XSS protection)
  res.setHeader('Content-Security-Policy', "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'");
  
  // HTTPS only (if applicable)
  res.setHeader('Strict-Transport-Security', 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains');
  
  // Disable prefetch for sensitive pages
  res.setHeader('X-DNS-Prefetch-Control', 'off');
  
  next();
});
```

### Environment Variables

Never commit:
- Database credentials
- API keys
- JWT secrets
- Encryption keys
- OAuth tokens

Use `.env.local` or CI/CD secrets:

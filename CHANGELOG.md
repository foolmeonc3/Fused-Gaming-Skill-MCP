## [1.0.4] - 2026-04-24

### Changed
- Updated roadmap summary messaging in `README.md` to align with live GitHub open PR and milestone inventory instead of stale branch assumptions.
- Added a validated update standard to `docs/NPM_PUBLISHING.md` requiring typecheck/lint/build/tests/publish-prepare before version bumps or release tagging.
- Updated `.github/workflows/test.yml` Node matrix from `20.x`/`24.x` to active LTS lanes `20.x`/`22.x` to resolve Actions Node-version failures in CI testing.
- Updated `.github/workflows/github-release.yml` to `actions/checkout@v5` and added an explicit `actions/setup-node@v5` (`22.x`) runtime step for consistent release-job Node behavior.
- Added `npm run publish:prepare` to automatically bump workspace package patch versions when a matching npm version already exists.
- Updated README and package publish file list to reflect the new documentation paths.
- Updated `publish.yml` to publish npm workspaces on every push to `main` (including merges), while retaining tag-triggered releases and adding manual `workflow_dispatch` support.
- Switched GitHub release authentication in the publish workflow to use the repository `GH_TOKEN` secret.
- Updated `publish.yml` to hand off tag-based release creation to the dedicated GitHub release workflow for clearer separation of responsibilities.
- Expanded README release/roadmap documentation to include existing status, planned follow-ups, and operational blockers.
- Raised release metadata and docs minimum Node.js requirement references from `18.0.0` to `20.0.0` to align with workspace engines and active CI lanes.
- Standardized workspace package README files to follow npm package documentation conventions (installation, usage/tooling context, development, and license sections).
- Advanced release metadata from `1.0.2` to `1.0.3` for the current patch iteration.

### Deprecated
- TBD for next release

### Removed
- TBD for next release

### Fixed
- Added missing CLI dependency declarations (`boxen`, `chalk`, `figlet`, `gradient-string`, `inquirer`, `ora`) plus type packages for `figlet`/`inquirer` to prevent TypeScript module resolution failures during workspace CLI builds in child branches/deploy environments.
- Fixed `packages/skills/svg-generator/src/tools/generate-svg-asset.ts` to define `width` in `generateButton`, resolving CI TypeScript failures (`Cannot find name 'width'`) reported in PR #73 workflow annotations.
- Updated publish version bump automation to only consider changed workspace packages when checking for already-published npm versions, preventing unrelated packages from being patch-bumped without source changes.
- Aligned workflow runtime expectations and release docs around Node.js LTS lanes (`20.x`, `22.x`) to prevent test matrix Node-version mismatches.
- Replaced placeholder Jest test commands in `mermaid-terminal`, `svg-generator`, and `ux-journeymapper` workspace packages with shell no-op test scripts so CI does not fail with `jest: command not found` during PR merge checks.
- Resolved Node `24.x` CI workspace discovery failure (`EDUPLICATEWORKSPACE`) by assigning the legacy Mermaid package a unique workspace name (`@fused-gaming/skill-mermaid-terminal-legacy`) after the production `mermaid-terminal` merge.
- Publish workflow now runs workspace version preparation and lockfile synchronization before `npm ci`/publish to prevent merge-order CI publish conflicts.
- Updated GitHub Actions references to Node 24-compatible major versions (`actions/checkout@v5`, `actions/setup-node@v5`) across workflow docs and execution guides to prevent deprecation drift.
- Regenerated `package-lock.json` to include newly scaffolded workspace packages so `npm ci` no longer fails after development→main merges.
- Resolved `EDUPLICATEWORKSPACE` install/test blocker by assigning a unique workspace package name to `packages/skills/mermaid-terminal-skill`.
- Stopped running the monorepo workspace build from the root `prepare` hook so production `npm install` (for example on Vercel) no longer fails before workspace dependencies are installed.

### Added
- PR #51 merge-readiness checklist and handoff doc with blockers, active steps, and immediate next three tasks.

## 🚨 Current Blockers & Risk Mitigations

### Blocker #1: npm Registry Access in CI
- **Issue:** npm package publish can fail with HTTP 403 on transitive dependency resolution
- **Mitigation:** Pre-run `npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts` before `npm ci`
- **Status:** Mitigated in `.github/workflows/publish.yml`

### Blocker #2: TypeScript Ambient Type Loading
- **Issue:** `@types/*` packages auto-included from transitive deps during workspace builds
- **Mitigation:** Standardized `tsconfig.json` extends patterns across workspaces
- **Status:** Fixed in packages/skills/*/ tsconfigs (Apr 17, 2026)

### Blocker #3: GitHub API Authentication
- **Issue:** Public PR pages cannot access full check/deployment status without auth
- **Mitigation:** Validate checks/deployments from authenticated GitHub Actions runner
- **Status:** Documented in CLAUDE.md for next agent

   - Gossip coordinator (eventual consistency)
   - Quorum manager (dynamic membership)
3. Use the new AgentBootstrapManager and HNSWMemorySynchronizer as foundation
4. Integrate consensus agents into agent-bootstrap groups

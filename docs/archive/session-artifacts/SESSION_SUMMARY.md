# Session Summary: Complete Project Delivery with Proper Branching

## Update: 2026-04-13 — CI Stabilization (Node Matrix)

- Removed `any` types from multi-account session aggregation/review models to eliminate lint warnings that can fail stricter CI policies.
- Verified `npm ci`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npm test` all pass locally.
- Aligned `VERSION.json` Node minimum metadata with package engines (Node >=20).
- Added environment note in `CLAUDE.md` documenting GitHub API `403` limitations for unauthenticated PR discovery in this runtime.

**Date:** April 1, 2026  
**Duration:** Single comprehensive session  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Git Flow Model
- **Why:** Industry standard for team development
- **Benefit:** Clear separation of concerns (feature/*, release/*, hotfix/*)
- **Impact:** Maintains clean, reviewable history

### 2. PR-First Workflow
- **Why:** Ensures visibility of changes before implementation
- **Benefit:** Prevents surprise work, enables early discussion
- **Impact:** Team stays aligned on priorities

### 3. Goals & Metrics in PRs
- **Why:** Makes success measurable and trackable
- **Benefit:** Clear objectives, quantifiable outcomes
- **Impact:** Accountability and progress visibility

### 4. Merge Commits (--no-ff)
- **Why:** Preserves feature branch history on main
- **Benefit:** Clear tracking of when features were integrated
- **Impact:** Easier to understand project evolution

### 5. Conventional Commits
- **Why:** Standard format for commit messages
- **Benefit:** Automated changelog generation possible
- **Impact:** Professional, traceable commit history

## Future Session Template

All future sessions should follow this framework:

```
1. CREATE FEATURE BRANCH
   git checkout -b feature/{issue}-{description}
   git push -u origin feature/{issue}-{description}

2. OPEN PR IMMEDIATELY
   - Add goals (what you're building)
   - Add success metrics (how to measure success)
   - Add technical approach (optional)
   - DO NOT make commits yet

3. MAKE COMMITS
   - Follow conventional format
   - Push regularly to remote
   - Reference PR in discussions

4. REQUEST REVIEW
   - Mark PR ready for review
   - Respond to feedback
   - Make requested changes

5. MERGE
   - Use GitHub UI (squash or merge commit)
   - Delete feature branch
   - Celebrate! 🎉
```

1. ✅ Feature branch created and pushed first (before commits)
2. ✅ Clear, descriptive commit messages
3. ✅ Comprehensive documentation at every step
4. ✅ Clean merge with no conflicts
5. ✅ Proper cleanup of feature branch

### What to Improve
1. ⚠️ Ensure all CI checks pass before merge (will do this next time with npm install)
2. ⚠️ Consider smaller, more focused commits
3. ⚠️ Add pre-commit hooks for linting
4. ⚠️ Set up branch protection rules on main

### For Next Sessions
1. Always create branch → push → open PR first
2. Add goals and success metrics to every PR

## Continuation Handoff (2026-04-13)

### Blockers
- No repository roadmap file found via local filename discovery (`roadmap`/`ROADMAP`/`plan` patterns).
- Live checks/deployments for PRs #38/#40/#41/#42/#43 are not fully observable from this environment due unauthenticated GitHub API/access limits (HTTP 403).

### Current Step Completed
- Kept CI publish troubleshooting anchored to the primary control point and confirmed lockfile synchronization is already integrated in `.github/workflows/publish.yml` immediately after `publish:prepare`.

### Immediate Next 3 Steps
1. Validate checks/deployments for PRs #38/#40/#41/#42/#43 in an authenticated GitHub Actions session.
2. Push a test tag (`v*` or `skill-*`) and confirm end-to-end publish success with the current lockfile sync sequence.
3. If publish failures persist, iterate first in `scripts/prepare-publish-versions.cjs` and `.github/workflows/publish.yml`.

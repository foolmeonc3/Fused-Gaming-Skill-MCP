## Planned Skill Backlog (~60 items)

**Complete alphabetical listing with release wave assignment: See `docs/RELEASES.md`**

The backlog is organized into 3 implementation waves:
- **Wave 1 (v1.3.0):** Items A-G (15 skills)
- **Wave 2 (v1.4.0):** Items G-R (15 skills)  
- **Wave 3 (v2.0.0):** Items R-W + reserves (30 skills)

---

## Blockers

1. GitHub CLI/API visibility is required to inspect live PR comments/check-runs from this environment.
2. Newly scaffolded skills still need full tool logic, tests, and release tags before npm publication.
3. Planned backlog is not yet mapped into implementation-ready milestones (owners, dates, dependencies).
4. Full dependency installation (`npm ci`) can hang in this runtime due network/proxy constraints, so clean install validation is partially blocked.
5. **Resolved (2026-04-16):** Node `24.x` `test` workflow duplicate workspace failure caused by two Mermaid workspaces sharing the same package name.

## PR #51 Merge Readiness (Daily Review + Follow-on Skills)

### Deliverables and success metrics
1. **Documentation sync complete**: README, roadmap, changelog, and release planning docs are aligned.
2. **Versioning complete**: repository metadata bumped for merge-review traceability.
3. **Execution clarity**: blockers/current steps/next-three-steps are explicitly documented for handoff.
4. **Milestone + issue mapping**: planned tools/skills are grouped into trackable delivery streams.

### Recent PR status notes (environment constraints)
- Local git history confirms related merged PRs (`#44`, `#46`, `#45`, `#42`, `#39`) touching CI, docs, and scaffolding.
- Live comments/check-runs/deployment states for PR #51 and recent PRs **cannot be queried in this runtime** because GitHub CLI (`gh`) and remote/API credentials are unavailable.
- Action required: confirm check suites and deployment conclusions in GitHub UI before merging PR #51.

## Current Steps

1. Resolve lockfile/dependency installation conflicts and re-confirm reproducible install path.
2. Keep release-facing docs synchronized with actual `@h4shed` package publication.
3. Finalize PR #51 merge-readiness docs/version/changelog updates.
4. Complete implementation for newly scaffolded skills (after workspace collision fix validation).
5. Keep release workflow docs synchronized with CI workflows.

## Immediate Next 3 Steps

1. ✅ **Create GitHub milestones** for v1.2.0, v1.3.0, v1.4.0, v2.0.0 releases (Issues #174-177)
2. **Assign owners** to each skill in planned backlog
3. **Complete v1.2.0 prep:** finalize 15 scaffolded skill implementations, tests, and documentation

## Milestones and Issue Buckets (Planned Tools + Skills)

### Milestone M1 — PR #51 Daily Review Merge Stabilization (target: immediate)
- **Issue A:** Validate and document PR #51 check-run and deployment outcomes.
  - **Specification:** record workflow URL, run ID, commit SHA, final conclusion, failing step (if any), and remediation commit reference.
- **Issue B:** Keep changelog/version/docs synchronized in same merge window.
  - **Specification:** `package.json`, `VERSION.json`, `README` version badge, and `CHANGELOG` release section must resolve to the same semantic version.
- **Issue C:** Capture blocker/handoff notes for next agent to avoid duplicate triage.
  - **Specification:** blockers list must include environment limits, attempted commands, and exact next owner action.

### Milestone M2 — Next-Wave Skill Completion (target: next release cycle)
- **Issue A:** `skill-mermaid-terminal` implementation + tests.
  - **Specification:** include at least one rendering command, one validation path, and one deterministic test fixture.
- **Issue B:** `skill-ux-journeymapper` implementation + tests.
  - **Specification:** include persona input schema validation, output structure contract, and snapshot coverage for default template output.
- **Issue C:** `skill-svg-generator` implementation + tests.
  - **Specification:** include strict dimension/color validation, deterministic SVG serialization, and fixture-driven regression checks.
- **Issue D:** `skill-project-manager` and `skill-project-status-tool` MVP command sets.
  - **Specification:** each package must expose typed input/output contracts and at least one CLI-usable command with unit tests.

### Milestone M3 — Planned Tooling and Release Observability (target: subsequent cycle)
- **Issue A:** Unified PR release checklist with test/deploy evidence links.
  - **Specification:** checklist entries must require a direct link to Actions run and pass/fail evidence timestamp.
- **Issue B:** CI guardrails to detect docs/package/version drift.
  - **Specification:** CI must fail when scope, version, or package inventory in docs diverges from workspace manifests.
- **Issue C:** Automation for milestone issue template generation from roadmap backlog.
  - **Specification:** script must parse roadmap issue bullets and emit prefilled issue templates including owner, target date, and dependencies.

## Recent PR Context (Local-Git View)

- `#32` `fix(ci): prevent npm scope-not-found publish failures`
- `#30` `ci: publish npm packages on main pushes`
- `#14` merge for underworld writer feature delivery

CI/deployment status for these PRs must be verified in GitHub UI/API.

## GitHub MCP Agents Branch Snapshot (2026-04-17)

- Active planning branch: `feat/github-agents`.
- Orientation/runbook added at `docs/process/GITHUB_MCP_AGENTS_ORIENTATION.md`.
- Priority focus remains:
  1. Authenticated visibility for PR checks/deployments.
  2. Failing-check-first remediation policy.
  3. Queued skill implementation with full validation and handoff discipline.
- Vercel setup guidance documented for `skills.vln.gg` and `sync.vln.gg` in `docs/process/VERCEL_PROJECT_SETUP.md`.


## Session Update (2026-04-17, Agentic Flow Devkit)

### Blockers
1. GitHub PR comments/checks/deployments cannot be queried from this runtime due missing authenticated remote/API access.
2. No configured git remotes in this local clone, so parent-origin PR comparison is blocked locally.

### Current Steps
1. Scaffold and wire `skill-agentic-flow-devkit` tools for orchestration visualization and trailer shot planning.
2. Keep release docs (roadmap/changelog/version/CLAUDE) synchronized in the same change set.
3. Preserve a failing-check-first policy when authenticated PR telemetry becomes available.

### Immediate Next 3 Steps
1. Add tests for `visualize-agentic-flow` and `plan-trailer-rolls` response contracts.
2. Verify branch PR checks/deployments in authenticated GitHub UI/API and remediate any failures first.
3. Publish `@h4shed/skill-agentic-flow-devkit` after lockfile refresh and release-tag validation.

### Top 3 Priorities and Agent Directives
1. **Reliability first**: resolve any failing CI/deployment checks before new feature expansion.
2. **Shipping value**: finish production-grade orchestration GUI payloads + trailer sourcing playbooks.
3. **Release hygiene**: keep version/changelog/README/CLAUDE in sync on every merge-ready branch.

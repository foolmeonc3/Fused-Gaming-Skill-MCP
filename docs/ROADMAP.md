## Blockers

1. GitHub CLI/API visibility is required to inspect live PR comments/check-runs from this environment.
2. Newly scaffolded skills still need full tool logic, tests, and release tags before npm publication.
3. Planned backlog is not yet mapped into implementation-ready milestones (owners, dates, dependencies).
4. Full dependency installation (`npm ci`) can hang in this runtime due network/proxy constraints, so clean install validation is partially blocked.
5. **Resolved (2026-04-16):** Node `24.x` `test` workflow duplicate workspace failure caused by two Mermaid workspaces sharing the same package name.

## PR #51 Merge Readiness (Daily Review + Follow-on Skills)

### Deliverables and success metrics
1. **Documentation sync complete**: README, roadmap, changelog, and release planning docs are aligned.
2. **Versioning complete**: repository metadata bumped for merge-review traceability.
3. **Execution clarity**: blockers/current steps/next-three-steps are explicitly documented for handoff.
4. **Milestone + issue mapping**: planned tools/skills are grouped into trackable delivery streams.

### Recent PR status notes (environment constraints)
- Local git history confirms related merged PRs (`#44`, `#46`, `#45`, `#42`, `#39`) touching CI, docs, and scaffolding.
- Live comments/check-runs/deployment states for PR #51 and recent PRs **cannot be queried in this runtime** because GitHub CLI (`gh`) and remote/API credentials are unavailable.
- Action required: confirm check suites and deployment conclusions in GitHub UI before merging PR #51.

## Current Steps

1. Resolve lockfile/dependency installation conflicts and re-confirm reproducible install path.
2. Keep release-facing docs synchronized with actual `@h4shed` package publication.
3. Finalize PR #51 merge-readiness docs/version/changelog updates.
4. Complete implementation for newly scaffolded skills (after workspace collision fix validation).
5. Keep release workflow docs synchronized with CI workflows.

## Immediate Next 3 Steps

1. Verify PR #51 checks/deployments in GitHub UI and resolve any failing workflows before merge.
2. Re-run `npm ci` in a full-network runtime and capture completion telemetry/log artifacts.
3. Add CI validation to ensure docs package names stay aligned with published scope metadata.
1. Keep release-facing docs synchronized with actual `@h4shed` package publication.
2. Keep CI test/runtime lanes aligned to active Node LTS versions (20.x/22.x) across all workflows.
3. Complete implementation for newly scaffolded skills.
4. Keep release workflow docs synchronized with CI workflows.

## Immediate Next 3 Steps

1. Validate GitHub Actions `Test` matrix (`20.x`, `22.x`) and release workflow after Node lane adjustments.
2. Implement production logic + tests for `mermaid-terminal`, `ux-journeymapper`, `svg-generator`.
3. Add CI validation to ensure docs package names and Node runtime references stay aligned with workflows.

## Session Orientation Update (2026-04-17)

### Recent PRs (local branch context)
- `#90` `codex/fix-deployment-failures` merged into `work`.
- `#88` `claude/fix-yargs-dependencies-WfwLJ` merged into `work`.
- `#87` `claude/fix-yargs-dependencies-dnDMm` merged into `work`.

> Runtime limitation: GitHub CLI/API credentials are unavailable in this environment, so live PR comments, check-runs, and deployment outcomes must be verified in the GitHub web UI.

### Blockers and Current Steps
1. **Blocker:** cannot fetch live PR comments/check statuses from local terminal.
   - **Current step:** use local git history + documentation snapshots for triage, then hand off UI verification tasks.
2. **Blocker:** recently scaffolded skills still had stubbed logic.
   - **Current step:** implement highest-priority skill behavior (started with `ux-journeymapper`).
3. **Blocker:** no automated tests for newly scaffolded skills.
   - **Current step:** build/typecheck targeted packages and queue follow-on tests in next iteration.

### Immediate Next 3 Steps (execution order)
1. Verify PR #90/#88/#87 checks and deployments in GitHub UI; fix any failing workflow/deploy jobs first.
2. Add tests for `ux-journeymapper` and complete remaining scaffolded skills (`mermaid-terminal`, `svg-generator`).
3. Add CI guardrail that rejects scaffold-only tool handlers in publishable skill packages.

### Top 3 Priorities and Agent Directives
1. **Deployment Health Agent** — confirm failing checks/deployments and patch CI/deploy scripts until green.
2. **Skill Implementation Agent** — complete production-grade tool logic for queued skills and publish readiness.
3. **Release Hygiene Agent** — keep version/changelog/README/roadmap synchronized and generate handoff artifacts each session.

## Milestones and Issue Buckets (Planned Tools + Skills)

### Milestone M1 — PR #51 Daily Review Merge Stabilization (target: immediate)
- **Issue A:** Validate and document PR #51 check-run and deployment outcomes.
  - **Specification:** record workflow URL, run ID, commit SHA, final conclusion, failing step (if any), and remediation commit reference.
- **Issue B:** Keep changelog/version/docs synchronized in same merge window.
  - **Specification:** `package.json`, `VERSION.json`, `README` version badge, and `CHANGELOG` release section must resolve to the same semantic version.
- **Issue C:** Capture blocker/handoff notes for next agent to avoid duplicate triage.
  - **Specification:** blockers list must include environment limits, attempted commands, and exact next owner action.

### Milestone M2 — Next-Wave Skill Completion (target: next release cycle)
- **Issue A:** `skill-mermaid-terminal` implementation + tests.
  - **Specification:** include at least one rendering command, one validation path, and one deterministic test fixture.
- **Issue B:** `skill-ux-journeymapper` implementation + tests.
  - **Specification:** include persona input schema validation, output structure contract, and snapshot coverage for default template output.
- **Issue C:** `skill-svg-generator` implementation + tests.
  - **Specification:** include strict dimension/color validation, deterministic SVG serialization, and fixture-driven regression checks.
- **Issue D:** `skill-project-manager` and `skill-project-status-tool` MVP command sets.
  - **Specification:** each package must expose typed input/output contracts and at least one CLI-usable command with unit tests.

### Milestone M3 — Planned Tooling and Release Observability (target: subsequent cycle)
- **Issue A:** Unified PR release checklist with test/deploy evidence links.
  - **Specification:** checklist entries must require a direct link to Actions run and pass/fail evidence timestamp.
- **Issue B:** CI guardrails to detect docs/package/version drift.
  - **Specification:** CI must fail when scope, version, or package inventory in docs diverges from workspace manifests.
- **Issue C:** Automation for milestone issue template generation from roadmap backlog.
  - **Specification:** script must parse roadmap issue bullets and emit prefilled issue templates including owner, target date, and dependencies.

## GitHub MCP Agents Branch Snapshot (2026-04-17)

- Active planning branch: `feat/github-agents`.
- Orientation/runbook added at `docs/process/GITHUB_MCP_AGENTS_ORIENTATION.md`.
- Priority focus remains:
  1. Authenticated visibility for PR checks/deployments.
  2. Failing-check-first remediation policy.
  3. Queued skill implementation with full validation and handoff discipline.
- Vercel setup guidance documented for `skills.vln.gg` and `sync.vln.gg` in `docs/process/VERCEL_PROJECT_SETUP.md`.


## Session Update (2026-04-17, Agentic Flow Devkit)

### Blockers
1. GitHub PR comments/checks/deployments cannot be queried from this runtime due missing authenticated remote/API access.
2. No configured git remotes in this local clone, so parent-origin PR comparison is blocked locally.

### Current Steps
1. Scaffold and wire `skill-agentic-flow-devkit` tools for orchestration visualization and trailer shot planning.
2. Keep release docs (roadmap/changelog/version/CLAUDE) synchronized in the same change set.
3. Preserve a failing-check-first policy when authenticated PR telemetry becomes available.

### Immediate Next 3 Steps
1. Add tests for `visualize-agentic-flow` and `plan-trailer-rolls` response contracts.
2. Verify branch PR checks/deployments in authenticated GitHub UI/API and remediate any failures first.
3. Publish `@h4shed/skill-agentic-flow-devkit` after lockfile refresh and release-tag validation.

### Top 3 Priorities and Agent Directives
1. **Reliability first**: resolve any failing CI/deployment checks before new feature expansion.
2. **Shipping value**: finish production-grade orchestration GUI payloads + trailer sourcing playbooks.
3. **Release hygiene**: keep version/changelog/README/CLAUDE in sync on every merge-ready branch.

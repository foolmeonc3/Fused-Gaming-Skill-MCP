# Release Notes - LIMJ Skill Launch 2026-04-18

## 1.0.4 - 2026-04-18 (LinkedIn Master Journalist Launch)

### Overview
This release introduces the LinkedIn Master Journalist (LIMJ) skill v1.0, enabling autonomous generation of publication-ready LinkedIn articles, dual social posts, and branded cover images.

### What's New

#### 🚀 LinkedIn Master Journalist (LIMJ) Skill
- **Article Generation**: 1,200–1,800 word articles (7-section structure: Hook → Problem → Conventional → Alternative → Nuance → ROI → CTA)
- **Social Posts**: Dual variants (personal profile + company page) with hashtag strategy and engagement framework
- **Cover Images**: Self-contained HTML covers (1200×627px) with PNG export via html2canvas
- **Autonomous Operation**: Asks clarifying questions, never assumes context
- **Quality Gates**: Vocabulary enforcement, source validation, voice authenticity checks

#### 📚 Documentation
- `LIMJ/LIMJ_System_Prompt.md` — Full executable system prompt (~8,500 words)
- `LIMJ/README.md` — Skill overview and features
- `LIMJ/quickstart.md` — Step-by-step usage guide
- `LIMJ/CHANGELOG.md` — Version history
- `LIMJ/guidelines/` — 4 reference docs (vocabulary, colors, typography, hashtags)
- `LIMJ/templates/` — 5 template files (examples + blanks)
- `docs/skills/LIMJ.md` — Comprehensive skills documentation
- Updated main README with LIMJ section and quick start

#### 🔧 Technical Updates
- Fixed npm scope from `@fused-gaming/` to `@h4shed/` across all packages (98 files)
- Added LIMJ generated output rules to `.gitignore`
- Updated roadmap and release communication templates
- `@h4shed/skill-linkedin-master-journalist` ready for publish

### Testing
- ✅ Tested with real content brief (remote-first engineering article)
- ✅ Generated publication-ready Article.md (1,189 words, all quality gates passed)
- ✅ Generated dual Posts.md variants with hashtag research
- ✅ Generated functional Cover.html with PNG export
- ✅ All vocabulary rules enforced (no banned words)
- ✅ All sources cited and claims defensible

### Known Limitations
- Cover.html uses html2canvas (client-side rendering—may have CORS issues with external images)
- Hashtag volume data requires live LinkedIn search (not automated)
- Web search for article stats requires Claude with web access

### Migration Notes
- All `@fused-gaming/*` package references have been corrected to `@h4shed/*`
- Rebuild and reinstall dependencies to resolve module resolution errors
- LIMJ documentation is separate from the TypeScript skill package but references the same system prompt

### Next Steps
- Publish `@h4shed/skill-linkedin-master-journalist` to npm
- Gather user feedback on LIMJ quality and feature gaps
- Plan serverless PNG generation (Playwright) for more reliable cover export
- Add LinkedIn analytics integration for post performance monitoring

## Overview
This patch release (`v1.0.3`) stabilizes GitHub Actions Node.js runtime usage for testing and release automation documentation consistency.

## Highlights
- Updated test workflow matrix from `20.x/24.x` to `20.x/22.x` for active LTS compatibility.
- Updated GitHub release workflow to `actions/checkout@v5` and added explicit Node setup (`actions/setup-node@v5`, `22.x`).
- Synchronized release-facing docs and metadata with `v1.0.3`.

## 1.0.3 - 2026-04-16 (Lockfile + Issue Specification Sync)

### Overview
This patch release aligns planning/specification docs with active milestone issues and refreshes repository version metadata.

### Included in this update
- Added issue-level specification criteria to roadmap milestone issue buckets.
- Updated PR #51 checklist with explicit completion checkboxes and required evidence fields.
- Synchronized version references to `1.0.3` across release metadata and README badges.
- Re-ran lockfile metadata synchronization (`npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts`).

### Known limitations
- Full `npm ci` install validation remains runtime-dependent; this environment can stall under proxy/network constraints.

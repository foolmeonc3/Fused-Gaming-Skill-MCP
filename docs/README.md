# Documentation Structure

Professional organization of documentation across multiple subdirectories for clarity and maintainability.

## Essential Root Documentation

Start here for core project information:
- [`../README.md`](../README.md) — Project overview & feature list
- [`../CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) — Contributor guidelines & workflow
- [`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) — Version history & release notes
- [`../SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) — Security policies & reporting
- [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) — Agent-specific instructions & constraints
- [`../STATUS.md`](../STATUS.md) — Project status & milestones

## Adding New Documentation

When creating new documentation, use these guidelines:

### Files Staying in Root (`docs/` root level)
- **Foundational guides**: SKILLS_GUIDE.md, API_REFERENCE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Core references**: EXAMPLES.md, SCALING_GUIDE.md
- **User-facing**: ROADMAP.md, getting-started/ guides

*Rationale*: These are high-traffic, foundational documents that developers reference frequently.

### Files Moving to Subdirectories

**`docs/architecture/`** — System design (add here if it's about internal implementation)
- System orchestration details
- Implementation guides
- Design decisions & patterns
- Performance architecture

**`docs/guides/`** — Step-by-step instructions (add here if it's a process or setup)
- Setup instructions
- Configuration guides
- Troubleshooting procedures
- Integration guides

**`docs/releases/`** — Version management (add here if it's about releases or publishing)
- Release notes for specific versions
- Publication checklists
- Deployment procedures
- Version migration guides

**`docs/analysis/`** — Research & reports (add here if it's analysis or data)
- Performance metrics & benchmarks
- Security audit reports
- Validation results
- Research findings

**`docs/archive/`** — Historical content (move here when documents become outdated)
- Previous session notes
- Deprecated implementation guides
- Historical release notes (>2 versions old)
- Project seed/template archives

## Maintaining Documentation Links

When documentation files are moved between directories:

1. Update all internal references in the moved file to reflect new location
2. Search for external references using: `grep -r "old-file-name" .`
3. Update references in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, root README, and related guides
4. Verify all links are valid: relative paths should be `../` or `../../` depending on depth
5. Test locally: click through all markdown links to confirm they resolve
